Middleware service for transferring welcome and deposit bonues

### Installation

This module is a part of middleware services. You can install it in 2 ways:

1) through core middleware installer  [middleware installer](https://github.com/ChronoBank/middleware)
2) by hands: just clone the repo, do 'npm install', set your .env - and you are ready to go

#### About
This module is used for transferring different kind of bonuses in nem blockchain for the chronobank's users. For the moment, there are 3 main bonuses:

##### Welcome bonus
This bonus is sent to all users (1 chronobank:minute asset in nem blockchain), who has added his account on chronobank platform (filled in profile). This bonus relies on sethash event, recieved from chronobank's smart contracts.

##### Deposit bonus
The deposit bonus sends bonus, based on deposited amount o minutes. The bonus works like so:
1) user A deposit 10 minutes
2) an event in smart contacts occured
3) we look through these events for each user, and find the maximum deposit amount and send the appropriate amount of money
4) in case, the bonus has been sent, but certain user deposited again, and the deposit amount is bigger than previous one, then we just send him delta (newMaxDeposit - oldMaxDeposit).


#### xem bonus
The xem bonus is aimed to give users bonus based on their xem amount. The rules are the same as for deposit bonus, except 2 things:
1) bonus is calculated based on money (xem) amount in nem blockchain.
2) the balance is taken between certain blocks (start and end height)

#### How does it work

There are 2 cases, when you can recieve some mosaic's minutes on your presonal count:
1) when you fill in profile
2) when you make a deposit

Under the hood, this module tracks events from  [sc-processor](https://github.com/ChronoBank/middleware-eth-chrono-sc-processor). In case, we meet setHash event (which stands for user fill profile's action) or deposit event - we just grab the address of user, and amount of deposit (in case it's deposit event) - and transfer him mosaics on his NEM's address
